#hello-world!

I am Bakul, from Varanasi. I am just a beginner and enthusiastic about technology.
I might be somewhat slow, but I have the gift of doing it complete.
Right now, I can...

* C
* C++ (Had that borland one in school, but also comfortable with the new standards)
* Python (Bae)
* do some SysAdmin stuff on Linux
* HTML
* CSS
* Javascript (just begun, No DOM till now)
* Matlab and GNU Octave

BTW, in the war of editors,I love vim and emacs both, but side with vim more on daily use as it is lightweight and natural to me :P, so I am a follower of KISS.

I am powered on Arch and on another machine with Fedora, again KISS with Arch but not so KISS with the big lady Fedora :P.

I am fascinated by low level things being a freshman to Electronics, but also interested in everything else :P.

I hate GNOME and KDE, BTW. XD

Thank you for lending your eyes on this awfully framed intro. 

Have a nice day, let the happiness worm infect more and more people. ;)
