 # About me
----------------------------

HELLO!! My name is Shravan Nayak aka "BAJUKA". 
No no its not "BAZUKA", its "BAJUKA".
This is the first question i get from many people who hear about my handle, so i felt it necessary to mention.
 I  am from electronics department ,a fresher, who is fascinated by the computer world. 
My main interest lies in machine learning and artificial intelligence and their application in the field of electronics(*although i don’t know much*). 
Well, i am new to the open source world or any other coding related world. 
Learnt a bit of java in high school but did not get any opportunity to experiment with it.
 My real exposure to cs started after i came to IIT BHU when i started  competitive coding. 
Besides, coding and stuff I like to read about the latest developments going on in the field of technology. 

  
 ## Skills
 ---------------------------
 
  As, I mentioned I am new to this world so my skills and experiences are limited or none but i have a strong will and necessary dedication to learn and keep improving myself. My current skills are-:

- C
- C++
- Python 
- HTML/CSS (basics)
- Djanjo (basics)

Well, may not be much but i will keep on expanding and assure u that i will show results ..


## Why open source?
-------------------------------

Because I want to improve my skills. 
Through open source  I will be able to make myself a better programmer and also get a chance to share my ideas with the world so that my ideas may help someone or I get a chance to learn from others. 
Take this report for example, I got an idea to structure this after seeing shivansh’s report. 
So i learnt here from someone else work and i hope one day someone else gets to learn something from my work :3 .
 

  
 
#### Well, that was about me .*Thanking  YOU...*
