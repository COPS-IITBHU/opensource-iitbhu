## About Me
Hi There!
I am Amritansh Singhal, a freshman at IIT-BHU pursuing Computer Science and Engineering. Geeky stuff has always indulged me and I've been enjoying writing programes and codes right from when I was taught QBasic in Standard V.
I am all in to learn and explore various fields of Computer Science and apply practically the skills which I would acquire over the course of time. 
## Skills
+ C/C++ Programming
+ Python Programming
+ HTML, CSS and JS
+ A Bit of ReactJS
----------
## Interests
Talking about interests, I am really in love with Python. The simplicity and the power of the language is just awesome. Besides Python, I've recently started learning Machine Learning and am quite intrigued by it's applications. 
Apart from Python, I found lolcode(pun intended) to be quite interesting. Just look at its code! How friendly it is!
#### That's all from me. Bye!
