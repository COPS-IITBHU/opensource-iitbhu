# About Me

Hi there, I am Raghav Sangar , B-Tech CSE, IIT BHU Varanasi. I started my journey as a programmer in 7th Class and Java was the first proper language i learnt(No, BASIC isnt a proper language) in my 8th Class. Since then i've explored various areas in Computer Science from OOP to Working on Computer Graphics owing to my interest in knowing what's behind the scenes.

## SKILLS

Though I am yet to discover where my true passion lies in the vast domain of Computer Science, I am comfortable with the following:

* Java/C/C++/Python
* Android Development(Java)
* Web Development(Frontend and Backend)
* Game Development

Still got a lot to explore before I find my area of expertise.
